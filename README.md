Uber Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing Uber trip data using various AWS services and data engineering tools. The goal is to extract insights from the dataset, process it using AWS Glue, query it with AWS Athena, and visualize the results using Amazon QuickSight. The dataset contains information about Uber trips, including details such as trip distance, passenger count, and pickup locations.

Tools and Technologies Used
Amazon S3: Used for storing the Uber dataset.
AWS Glue: Employed for data cleaning, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, and creating a data catalog.
AWS Athena: Utilized for querying the processed data stored in S3.
Amazon QuickSight: Used for visualizing the data and generating insights.
MySQL: Initially used to load and explore the dataset before transferring it to AWS services.
Python & Pandas: Used for initial data exploration and transformation tasks before loading the data onto AWS.
AWS CLI: Command Line Interface used to interact with AWS services, including S3 for data upload.
GitHub: Version control and project collaboration.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Uber Trip Data. It contains the following fields:

trip_id: Unique identifier for each trip.
pickup_datetime: The date and time when the trip started.
dropoff_datetime: The date and time when the trip ended.
passenger_count: The number of passengers on the trip.
trip_distance: The distance covered during the trip.
pickup_location: The location where the trip started.
dropoff_location: The location where the trip ended.
rate_code: The rate code used for the trip.
payment_type: The method of payment.
Project Workflow
Data Loading:

Loaded the Uber dataset into MySQL for initial exploration.
Exported the data to Amazon S3 for further processing.
Data Processing with AWS Glue:

Created a Glue Crawler to catalog the data stored in S3.
Ran Glue ETL jobs to clean and transform the data.
Querying with AWS Athena:

Used Athena to write SQL queries on the processed data to extract insights.
Data Visualization with Amazon QuickSight:

Connected QuickSight to the Athena queries.
Created visualizations to showcase key insights from the data.
